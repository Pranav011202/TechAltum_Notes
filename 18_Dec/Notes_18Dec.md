## Notes of the Class ( 18 Dec )

* head contains information not visible to the user (i.e meta data )
* W3C validation extension would check the valdation
* There is no error if we dont close the headings unlike tags like paragraphs 
*  Title and meta(description) is for the seo while meta tag for the description is not compulsory as per w3c validation 
* This meta name viewport tag was introduced by apple when the iphone was launched as touchscreen phone was introduced by apple (but infact its not compulsory as per w3c Validation)
* doctype and comment is not a tag 
* Around 144 tags are there 
* Attributes addition piece of information eg class , id 
* meta tags are never closed as its self closing ( or hr tags or br tags or input or img) these are known as void tags 
* Unlike void tags we have pair tags which require closing 
* html5 s pahle it was xhtml 
* Void tags never have parent child relationship and they cannot contain text 
* In img tag both src and alt attribute are compulsary 
* in <html lang="en"> we write we dont need to give an attribute the direction bcz by default these languages are from left to  right but for languages like urdu we need to give a direction attribute 
* Later on when we make Single page application we would require base tag in head 
* This meta tag <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge"> basically is not compulsary but it is for the compatibility for the internet explorer which is not shut by the microsoft
