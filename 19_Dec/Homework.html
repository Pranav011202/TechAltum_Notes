    <!-- Main Title -->
    <h1>Population-Based Algorithms</h1>
    <p>Population-based algorithms are optimization techniques inspired by natural processes, such as evolution and swarm behavior. These algorithms solve complex problems by exploring multiple solutions simultaneously, making them effective for real-world applications.</p>

    <h2>Key Characteristics</h2>
    <p>Population-based algorithms share several key characteristics that make them powerful tools for optimization:</p>
    <h3>Global Optimization</h3>
    <p>Unlike traditional techniques, these algorithms search the entire solution space to find the global optimum, avoiding local optima.</p>
    <h3>Parallelism</h3>
    <p>They process multiple solutions (a population) simultaneously, which enhances their ability to explore diverse regions of the solution space.</p>
    <h3>Adaptability</h3>
    <p>These algorithms can adapt to a variety of complex and dynamic problems, making them highly versatile.</p>

    <h2>Types of Population-Based Algorithms</h2>
    <p>Several types of population-based algorithms are widely used in optimization and machine learning:</p>
    <h3>Genetic Algorithms (GA)</h3>
    <p>Inspired by natural selection, genetic algorithms use processes like selection, crossover, and mutation to evolve solutions.</p>
    <h3>Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)</h3>
    <p>PSO mimics the behavior of swarms, such as flocks of birds or schools of fish, to find optimal solutions.</p>
    <h3>Ant Colony Optimization (ACO)</h3>
    <p>ACO models the behavior of ants in finding the shortest path to a food source by using pheromones as a guiding mechanism.</p>
    <h4>Hybrid Algorithms</h4>
    <p>Hybrid algorithms combine features of multiple population-based methods to enhance their performance and efficiency.</p>
